# Navigating-Genbank

The purpose of this is to show an example of how one would write scripts in Biopython to navigate GenBank and create dataframes to to collect information on biosynthetic gene clusters (BCGs) of different species. Here, we collect BCG information from two different species of fungi, Aspergillus Nidulans and Aspergillus tubingensis.
